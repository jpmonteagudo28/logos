The goal of `logos` is to give access to the Greek New Testament (27
books) and the Tanach (39 books) and allow users to do textual analysis
on the data. The New and Old Testament have been provided in their
original languages, Greek and Hebrew, respectively. Additionally, the
~~English Standard Version (ESV)~~ *Revised American Standard Bible*
(RASB) is also provided for users who’d rather use a word–for–word
modern (1901) English translation.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `logos` like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github("jpmonteagudo28/logos")
```

or download the package from CRAN like so:

``` r
install.packages("logos")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
# library(logos)
## basic example code
```
