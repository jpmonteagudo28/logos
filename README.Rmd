The goal of `logos` is to give access to the Greek New Testament (27 books) and the Tanach (39 books) and allow users to do textual analysis on the data. The New and Old Testament have been provided in their original languages, Greek and Hebrew, respectively. Additionally, the ~~English Standard Version (ESV)~~ *Revised American Standard Bible* (RASB) is also provided for users who'd rather use a word–for–word modern (1901) English translation.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `logos` like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github("jpmonteagudo28/logos")
```

or download the package from CRAN like so:
```r
install.packages("logos")
```

## How to

The main function in this package is the `select_passage()` function as it allows you to retrieve entire sections, books, chapters or verses of the English Bible (RASB), Greek New Testament, and Hebrew Old Testament. The remaining functions are helpers that facilitate retrieval and manipulation of biblical text. 

Besides `select_passage()`, you have access to five datasets. The *Revised Standard American Bible*, 'rasb_bible', the *Society of Biblical Literature Greek New Testament*,'new_testament', and the *Leningrad Codex* containing the Old testament,'old_testament'. Two additional datasets are 'author_data' which contains a breakdown of the authors, dates, sections and books of the Old and New Testament, and 'verses_by_book', which provides a count of the total number of verses for each book of the bible. 

```r
library(logos)

# Let's grab a passage from the Gospel of John, chapter 1, verses 1 - 6
select_passage("Jhn",chapter = 1, verse = 1:6, language = "English", testament = "new)

# You can do so it a different language by changing the language argument
select_passage("Jhn",chapter = 1, verse = 1:6, language = "Greek", testament = "new)

# Notice that if you provide incompatible language and testament combinations for the Greek and Hebrew text, the function will throw an error and remind you to use the right combinations. 
select_passage("Jhn",chapter = 1, verse = 1:6, language = "Hebrew", testament = "new)
```

A secondary function is `peek()`, a base R replacement for dplyr's `glimpse()`. This function can be used to quickly get a sense of the data you'll be working with. 

```r
peek(old_testament)

peek(verses_by_book)
```

## Some real-life examples

Statistics have been applied to the field of biblical research for some years now, and the creation of the [stylo](https://github.com/computationalstylistics/stylo) and [quanteda](https://github.com/quanteda/quanteda) package have made it much easier to perform qualitative quantitative analysis on the biblical data. 

I leave a few interesting articles that show the intermingling of stats and scripture.

## Project status
Actively developed, though the pace has slowed now that I'm busier with other packages and my school work. I have no plans to substantially enlarge or extend it before really testing it.
